# Developing Applications with React

## Getting Started

At DeveloperTown we prefer to start applications with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) and Typescript. For more information on why we use Typescript see (languages.md)

```
npx create-react-app `<your app name>` --typescript
```

Create React App will bootstrap an new React App with most of the configuration required for DeveloperTown projects. However the following guides will cover extending the foundation establihed by Create React App with the standards expected for DeveloperTown projects

1. Configuring Code Formatters (see formatting.md)
2. Configuring Static Code analysis with Linters (see linting.md)
3. Building or Extending Component Libraries (see component-libraries.md)
4. Styling and Theming Applications (see styling.md)
5. Adding Internationalization Support (see i18n.md)
6. Adding Accessibility Support (see a11y.md)
7. Managing Application State (see state-management.md)
8. Testing (see testing.md)
