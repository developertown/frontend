# Developing Applications with React

## Getting Started

At DeveloperTown we prefer to start applications with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) and [Typescript](./languages.md)

```
npx create-react-app `<your app name>` --typescript
```

Create React App will bootstrap an new React App with most of the configuration required for DeveloperTown projects. However the following guides will cover extending the foundation establihed by Create React App with the standards expected for DeveloperTown projects

1. [Configuring Code Formatters](./formatting.md))
2. [Configuring Static Code analysis with Linters](./linting.md)
3. [Building or Extending Component Libraries](./component-libraries.md)
4. [Styling and Theming Applications](./styling.md)
5. [Adding Internationalization Support](./i18n.md)
6. [Adding Accessibility Support](./a11y.md)
7. [Managing Application State](./state-management.md)
8. [Testing](./testing.md)
