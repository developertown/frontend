# Developing Applications with React

## Getting Started

At DeveloperTown we prefer to start applications with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) and [Typescript](./languages.md)

```
yarn create react-app `<your app name>` --template file:./cra-template
```

or if you want to configure everything yourself

```
yarn create react-app `<your app name>` --template typescript
```

Create React App will bootstrap an new React App with most of the configuration required for DeveloperTown projects. However the following guides will cover extending the foundation establihed by Create React App with the standards expected for DeveloperTown projects
